### Chrome Tabs in Chrome

Modified version of [Chrome Tabs](https://github.com/adamschwartz/chrome-tabs) by [@adamschwartz](https://github.com/adamschwartz).

Features:

* Relies no more on [Draggabilly](https://github.com/desandro/draggabilly) by [@desandro](https://github.com/desandro)
    - No longer works on Mozilla Firefox because [11 years is not enough to fix a bug apparently](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=505521).
        
        I want to use it in Electron so I don't know if I will program a workaround.
* Converted to an ES6 module
* Open/close tab on middle click
* Tabs are draggable in other tab strips (WIP)
